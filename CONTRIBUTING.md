## Dear colleagues:

 ## let me announce the war between the PIDC-NN under the law of scientist Max Planck and the inventor Elmer Sperry in order to destroy the reputation of convolutional neural networks  (CNNs)that was established based on simple mathematical calculation. Anyone is welcome to be a contributor to this project. All contributors must respect the blood wolf rules. 

## see https://github.com/REFATESHAQ/PIDC-NN_MinerNet, and https://github.com/REFATESHAQ/PIDC-NN_MinerNet-Pro. your idea is valuable to this project. 


## Anyone is welcome to be a contributor to this project to increase the capability of computer vision in all fields such as Medicine, Agriculture, Industry, etc. All contributors should respect the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3, 19 November 2007.
